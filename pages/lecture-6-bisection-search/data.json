Write a piece of Python code that uses bisection search to guess N. The code prints two lines: count: with how many guesses it took to find N, and answer: with the value of N. Hints: If the halfway value is exactly in between two integers, choose the smaller one.\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026ldquo;https://ocw-studio.odl.mit.edu/sites/6100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python/type/resource/edit/7887b2cc-3d12-4dee-ab69-0de71020d95d/?ocw_resource_link_uuid=7887b2cc-3d12-4dee-ab69-0de71020d95d\u0026ocw_resource_link_suffix=\"\u003e6.100L Finger Exercises Lecture 6 Solutions\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n"}
