Returns a sorted list of the keys in aDict with the value target. If aDict does not contain the value target, returns an empty list. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Your code here # Examples: aDict = {1:2, 2:4, 5:2} target = 2 print(keys_with_value(aDict, target)) # prints the list [1,5] Question 2: Implement the function that meets the specifications below:\ndef all_positive(d): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; d is a dictionary that maps int:list Suppose an element in d is a key k mapping to value v (a non-empty list). Returns the sorted list of all k whose v elements sums up to a positive value. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Your code here # Examples: d = {5:[2,-4], 2:[1,2,3], 1:[2]} print(all_positive(d)) # prints the list [1, 2] 6.100L Finger Exercises Lecture 14 Solutions\nRecitation 7 Recitations were smaller sections that reviewed the previous lectures.
