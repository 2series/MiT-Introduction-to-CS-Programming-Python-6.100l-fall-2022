Returns the value of the quadratic a×x² + b×x + c. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Your code here # Examples: print(eval_quadratic(1, 1, 1, 1)) # prints 3 Question 2: Implement the function that meets the specifications below:\ndef two_quadratics(a1, b1, c1, x1, a2, b2, c2, x2): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; a1, b1, c1: one set of coefficients of a quadratic equation a2, b2, c2: another set of coefficients of a quadratic equation x1, x2: values at which to evaluate the quadratics Evaluates one quadratic with coefficients a1, b1, c1, at x1. Evaluates another quadratic with coefficients a2, b2, c2, at x2. Prints the sum of the two evaluations. Does not return anything. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Your code here # Examples: two_quadratics(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) # prints 6 print(two_quadratics(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)) # prints 6 then None 6.100L Finger Exercises Lecture 7 Solutions\nRecitation 3 Recitations were smaller sections that reviewed the previous lectures.
