# 1. Assume 3 variables are already defined for you: a, b, and c. Create a variable called total that adds a and b and then multiplies that sum by c. Include a last line in your code to print the value: print(total)

# a = 1
# b = 2
# c = 3

# total = (a + b) * c

# print(total)

# 2. Assume you are given a variable named number (has a numerical value). Write a piece of Python code that prints out one of the following strings:


# * positive if the variable number is positive
# * negative if the variable number is negative
# * zero if the variable number is equal to zero

number = 1

if number > 0:
    print("positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("negative")
else:
    print("zero")
